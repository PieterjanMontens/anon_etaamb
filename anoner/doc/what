What does anoner do ? What does it expose ?

Do: 
    It builds an internal database/profile of a language, maybe even in different, modular ways.
    It can say, against those profiles, what the probability is of a word to be part of that language.
    It can also do that with whole texts. It can even return those texts with the less-probable words stripped.
    Or just return the words of a texts with a lower probablity then a certain given treshold.

Expose:
    word_add        -> adds a word to a given language profile
    word_del        -> removes a word from a given language profile
    word_check      -> sends back the probability of a word peing part of a profile.

    words_check     -> sends back all the given words with their specific probability
    words_filter    -> sends back only the words below a certain propability level

    text_anonymise  -> sends back text with the most improbable words stripped.

Modules:
    anoner        User Api
    anon_app      Application behaviour
    anon_sup      Root Supervisor
    anon_profile  Code for a single language profile
    anon_store    Storage for profile & cache data
	anon_patterns Code for subpatterns generation and grouping 

Store is started by app file,
profile is a child of the supervisor, it's an entry point. It also contains al the code to interact with it.
anoner exposes the functionality to the outside


Data format: the data stored by the store is just a key/value pair.
Nothing more. It shouldn't even know what it's storing, only how.
